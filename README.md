## About the reports

The reports folder contains finished OSINT reports intended as examples and teaching material. Each report usually includes:
- A written summary of the investigation and findings
- A list of evidence and where it came from
- Any supporting screenshots or exports (often redacted)

Please treat reports responsibly:
- Assume reports may contain personal or sensitive information — handle them with care.
- Do not publish or share unredacted personal data.
- If you find unredacted personal data, contact the repository owner to report it privately.
